# simMIPS
Simulates the MIPS Processor

The end goal is to simulate the MIPS Processor

But presently only the assembler is implemented which takes input the assembly instructions and produces 
the binary code. This has been done using regular expressions in c++ making it very flexible to accept
any instruction set and produce the corresponding binary output. The exact way to do this is in the code 
but a more detailed documentation is being developed.
